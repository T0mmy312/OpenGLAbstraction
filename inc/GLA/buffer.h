 * 
 * The frequency of usage may be one of these:
 *
 * Stream
 * - The data store contents will be modified once and used at most a few times.
 * 
 * Static
 * - The data store contents will be modified once and used many times.
 *
 * Dynamic
 * - The data store contents will be modified repeatedly and used many times.
 *
 * The nature of usage may be one of these:
 *
 * Draw
 * - The data store contents are modified by the application, and used as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.
 *
 * Read
 * - The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL, and used to return that data when queried by the application.
 *
 * Copy
 * - The data store contents are modified by reading data from the GL, and used as the source for GL drawing and image specification commands.
