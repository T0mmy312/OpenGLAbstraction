This project provides a low-\/level Open\+GL abstraction implemented in modern C++, using try-\/catch based error handling and classes representing various Open\+GL objects.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The recommended setup is to initialize and bind the Open\+GL context in main, and then create all Easy Open\+GL abstractions one scope deeper. This follows the RAII principle and ensures that all resources are properly cleaned up before the Open\+GL context is destroyed otherwise errors may occur during destruction and cleanup of Easy Open\+GL classes.
